Observations that have X3 over 45 belong to cluster 1. Finally cluster 4 contains data points very low value of X3 and X9. \n","Observations for cluster 0 to 2 are quite spread on the X9 axis and it seems there is a natural lower boundary for X3 of 20 (all data points are over 20). But we got few data points that are lower that this boundary (they all belong to cluster 3). These observations seem to be very different from all the other data points from clusters 0 to 2. We will classify them as anomaly and if this was a real project we would have reported these cases to the Risk department for further investigation.\n"]}]}
