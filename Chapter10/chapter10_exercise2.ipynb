If we look only at the properties with LotArea under 50,000, we can see a linear relationship: if we draw a straight line from coordinates (0,0) to (20000,800000), we can say that the SalePrice increases by 40,000 for each additional increase of 1,000 for LotArea. The formula of this straight line (or regression line) will be: SalePrice = 40000 * LotArea / 1000.

        "Congratulations in completing this exercise. We saw that using data visualisation we can get some valuable insights about the dataset. For instance, using a scatter plot, we identified a linear relationship between 'SalePrice' and 'LotArea' where the price tends to increase as the size of the property gets bigger. Histograms helped us to understand the distribution of the numerical variables and bar charts gave us a similar view for categorical variables. For example we saw there are more sold properties in some neighborhoods compared to others. Finally we were able to analyse and compare the impact of different values of a variable on 'SalePrice' through the use of boxplot. We saw that the better condition of property is, the higher the sale price will be. Data visualization is a very important tool for data scientists to explore and analyse datasets."
